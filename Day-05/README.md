# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Internship - Day 05 Documentation

## 📅 Day 05 - Footprinting & Reconnaissance



### 📌 Daily Objective
To understand the basics of **footprinting**, explore different techniques used in **reconnaissance**, and learn to use **Spiderfoot**, an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool for scanning domains and IP addresses.


###  New Topics Learned
- What is **Footprinting** in Ethical Hacking?
- Difference between:
  - 🔍 **Active Footprinting** – Direct interaction with the target
  - 🕵️ **Passive Footprinting** – Gathering information indirectly without indirection
- Real-world application of footprinting in vulnerability assessments


### 🛠️ New Methods
- Using **OSINT** techniques to gather intelligence on a target
- Identifying digital footprints from publicly available sources
- Automated domain and IP scanning using **Spiderfoot**
- Generating vulnerability reports and analyzing results


### 💻 New Commands / Tools
- Tool Used: **Spiderfoot**
- Scanned both **domain** and **IP address**
- Information collected:
  - Open Ports
  - WHOIS Details
  - Subdomains
- Created an **automated vulnerability report**

### 📄 Summary
 focused on the **reconnaissance phase** of ethical hacking. I learned the theory behind **footprinting** and practiced using Spiderfoot to gather information on a target. The session included scanning a domain and IP, analyzing results, and generating a report of possible vulnerabilities.


### ✅ Conclusion
Gained a strong understanding of **information gathering**—the first step in ethical hacking. Spiderfoot proved to be a powerful tool for identifying threats without touching the target system. This day laid the foundation for upcoming practical security assessments.
